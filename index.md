# Spring School

We announce the very first Spring School on Biological and Medical Visualization: the **Bio+Med+Vis Spring School**!

The Spring School will be held virtually during the week of **May 17--21, 2021**. Participants can anticipate a week full of excellent **talks**, given by leading experts in Biological and Medical Visualization. The program is enriched by **mentoring sessions**, focusing on Ph.D. studies and visualization design, practical **tutorials** on visualization tools and libraries, and invited talks by experts from **clinical practice and industry**.

The Spring School is primarily targeting M.Sc. and Ph.D. students in Computer Science, but anyone who wants to learn more about principles and challenges in visualization for Life Sciences applications is welcome! No preliminary knowledge of Bio+Medical visualization is necessary.

The registration for the Spring School will be **free of charge** and it will provide access to an educational platform, where all materials will be available, after the end of the educational week. To join us, just fill in the [registration form](https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=10020883) before **May 12, 2021**. 

We are very looking forward to seeing you at the Bio+Med+Vis Spring School!
