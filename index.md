# Bio+MedVis Spring School

We would like to announce and invite the participants of the very first Spring School with a focus on biological and medical visualizations!

The Spring School, held betwen May 17 and 21, 2021, will be fully virtual and you can expect a week full of excellent talks given by leading experts in biological and medical visualizations. The program is enriched by mentoring sessions focused on Ph.D. studies and visualization design, practical tutorials focusing on visualization tools and libraries, and invited talks given by experts from clinical practice and industry.

The spring school is primarily aimed at M.Sc. and Ph.D. students in Computer Science (but not limited to these), who want to learn more about the principles and challenges in visualization, targeting Life Sciences applications. No preliminary knowledge of BioMedical visualization is necessary.

The first BioMedSpring will be free of charge, including access to the educational platform, where all materials will be available after the end of the spring school week. To join us, just fill in the registration form.

We are very looking forward to seeing you at the Bio+MedVis Spring School! 

Johanna Beyer, Jan Byška, Ingrid Hotz, Barbora Kozlíková, Torsten Möller, Renata Raidou, Noeska Smit, and Hsiang-Yun Wu
