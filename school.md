# The Story of Spring School

Following the paradigm of last year’s online education, we are starting an initiative across institutions for an educational BioMedVis platform. The purpose is to build a growing curriculum that will bridge the domains of biological, medical, and biomedical visualization. Study materials from diverse fields in BioMedVis will be collected at different levels of detail and with varying required preliminary knowledge. As a starting point, we are organizing BioMedVis Spring School, which offers a set of talks on various visualization subjects from prestigious and established BioMedVis researchers, addressing different life sciences domains. BioMedVis Spring School is a unique opportunity for students to meet experts from all facets of our field.

The Spring School is primarily targeting the M.Sc. and Ph.D. students in Computer Science, who want to learn more about the principles, diversity of topics, and open challenges in Life Sciences applications. It is an excellent opportunity to meet the world-leading experts in these domains and discuss with them within the open sessions at the Spring School. The students will also learn about open positions for Ph.D. studies – the opportunity to join the top visualization teams.

The students can obtain a certificate of attendance, which will be sent upon request. Based on this certificate and depending on the rules of the student’s home institution, the student can obtain ECTS points for the Spring School. However, as different institutions have different requirements, it is impossible to unify this process. Therefore, we are leaving this up to the discretion of the mentor/supervisor to decide this.
